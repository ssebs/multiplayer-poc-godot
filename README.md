# Multiplayer POC godot

A Godot 4 multiplayer reference implementation. Originally created for [Dank Nooner](https://github.com/ssebs/DankNooner), this repo serves as a learning resource and code reference for anyone implementing multiplayer in Godot 4.

This project focuses on core networking concepts including:

- Client-server architecture using Godot's high-level multiplayer API
- Player synchronization and state management
- Network optimization and performance testing
- Connection handling and error recovery

Feel free to use this as a reference or starting point for your own Godot 4 multiplayer projects.

See [TODO.md](./TODO.md) for progress.
